📋 Description
  This script:

   - Takes an integer input from the user.
 
   - Prints the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10.

   - Uses a for loop and Python’s f-string for clean output formatting.

## 5. Discount Calculator 💰

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price after applying a discount based on the purchase amount. It's beginner-friendly and demonstrates the use of conditional statements and basic arithmetic operations in Python.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a total purchase amount.
2. Based on the amount, the program applies a discount according to the following rules:

| Purchase Amount (₹) | Discount |
|---------------------|----------|
| Less than 5000      | 0%       |
| 5000 - 9999         | 5%       |
| 10000 - 19999       | 10%      |
| 20000 - 49999       | 15%      |
| 50000 and above     | 20%      |

3. The program calculates:
   - Discount percentage
   - Discount amount
   - Final price after applying the discount
